    With the Smoothie Diet program we are focused on replacing some of your

    The weight loss created by the Smoothie Diet is a long term and sustainable weight-loss plan as it is simply about substituting delicious smoothies for one or two daily meals.

    On the Smoothie Diet, we encourage you prepare and drink two smoothies a day
    as meal replacements. The smoothie ingredients vary, focusing on lots of
    fruits and vegetables with some protein and healthy fats.


    The diet's e-book offers some guidance on the one solid-food meal followers are advised to consume each day (including recommendations for what to eat and some "whole food" recipes), as well as suggestions for low-sugar, high-fiber snacks. You are also allowed to eat normally one day per week, so long as the meals adhere to the recommendations in the e-book.
